# Assignment-4---Tetris-Racing
This is the second part of assignment 4


# Second part 

I chose to make the Tetris Racing game.

I did it with a picture of a road of 4 lines , which from each line every 'x' seconds coming an enemy car in different size , different color and different speed.

The red car is the player's car.

The goal is to dodge all the coming enemy cars .

When crushing into an enemy car - the game is over and an according message is displying.
